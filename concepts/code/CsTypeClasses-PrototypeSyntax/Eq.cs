    We translate Haskell’s qualified types as extra type parameters, constrained to be both structs and bound by translations of their type class constraints.

    For example, list membership in Haskell is
    elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> bool
    x `elem`  []            = False
    x `elem` (y:ys)         = x==y || (x `elem` ys)

        Of course, in CS we have to make Dictionary construction and passing (as types, not values) explicit. 
        This is what a modified C# compiler would hopefully be able to do for you, 
        just like Haskell does by solving constraints to construct dictionaries at compile time.

        The point is that the underlying mechanism for implementing Haskell Type Classes is already there!
